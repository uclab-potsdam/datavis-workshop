    "This is a simple notebook to work with Selenium and Chrome Webdriver in order to scrape a dynamic website. While for static websites we can use [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/), when we are working with dynamic ones we need Selenium. The key aspect of [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) is that it executes javascript when loading a page request, this allows for dynamic websites to be scraped easily. For the purpose of this exercise we will use [Chrome WebDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/), a tool for automated testing of web apps. To complete our exercise we will also use [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/), the data science and data analysis library, in order to create a dataframe and export our data to our local machine.\n",

    "Each website is different, therefore scraping is often a tailored activity that requires some coding and strategizing effort. This tutorial presented some simple features and a couple of useful patterns if you need to scrape a relatively contained amount of data. There are more complex and articulated tasks that require more savviness, time and computing effort. One example are social media. For special or recurring cases there's a useful collection of tools that can be found [here](https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/ToolDatabase)."
